OBJECTIVE

You will encounter an issue when trying to launch an upgrade. Your goal is
to fix the issue and successfully launch a upgrade in manual mode:

    sudo ./gravity upgrade --manual

Once the upgrade has successfully launched in manual mode:

  * Manually step through the phases until the system-upgrade phase.
  * Perform a rollback.
