SCENARIO #5 ACTIVATED.

OBJECTIVE
---------

The upgrade process and requirements have now been tampered.

A manual upgrade has been already started, you can check the plan with

sudo ${path}/gravity plan

and

sudo ${path}/gravity status

Your goal is to inspect the upgrade plan and status and fix current issues.

Once you have executed a few upgrade phases, rollback the cluster to the original state.

    cd $1
    sudo ./gravity rollback
