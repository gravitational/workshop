SCENARIO #3 ACTIVATED.

OBJECTIVE
---------

You will encounter an issue when trying to launch an upgrade. Your goal is
to fix the issue and successfully launch a upgrade in manual mode:

    cd $1
    sudo ./gravity upgrade --manual

Once the upgrade has successfully launched in manual mode, rollback the
operation so the cluster returns to the active state:

    sudo ./gravity rollback
"
